# Tentaizu

# A Japanese  game  also known as “celestial  map”, which although is like minesweeper, its not. 
 
## The  game  is  played  on  a  7x7  board. Where exactly  10  of the 49 squares are each hiding a star.  The players task is to determine which squares are hiding the stars.  

## Clues are provided in the sqaures of the board :
### * A  number  in  a  square  indicates  how  many  stars  lies in the boxes adjecent or diagonal to the given square with the number
### * A  square  with  a number in it will not contain a star, yet a star can appear in a square with no adjacent numbers. 

# I designed a algorithm using backtracking that solves a given tentaizu board in a quick runtime


# TO RUN:

## javac tentaizu.java 

## java tentaizu < input.in > myoutput.out
